      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>It all started with the Cricut. Throughout her life, Jess has always been an avid card maker. Whether it be birthdays, holidays, or celebration, she always gifted a hand made card.
Inspiration to establish an Etsy shop and sell her designs came from the her love for the Fall and Halloween. The season brings on a whirlwind of ideas and creativity, and after two years of mastering her craft she decided to open up shop for her favorite season, Halloween. Jess has always been a very positive and powerful woman and wants to empower other woman as well with her designs. She believes in feeling good and being comfortable in your own skin.</p>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Jess has always had a can do mentality where she will see decorations in a store and think, “I can make that!” It started off with card making and slowly evolved to holiday decorations, from Christmas wreathes to eater garlands and after receiving a Cricut, her love and passion only evolved. She started off by using her Cricut to print and cut iron-on-vinyl for shirts but the texture of the material was just not as appealing. One day, she stumbled across a woman, pigskinsandpigtails on IG, who was using her Cricut to make a stencil and using that to screen print. Jess ended up watching all her video and signing up to her tutorials. It completely changed her crafting style and she found a new passion in traditional screen printing.
Her current designs are inspired by the fall season and Halloween as well as showcasing body positivity. Family, inclusiveness, and even music are big inspirations that she likes to share with her family and aspired to share it with her clientele. </p>

        <img src="images/screen.jpg" alt="Printing Screen" width="35%">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>It starts off with an idea or a concept. From there Jess uses Design Space, a Cricut software, to start designing. She starts by importing images or fonts she finds online and starts piecing them together, playing with the layout and adding embellishments or changing up the font to fit the theme. She usually makes a couple of mock-ups and gets her loved ones input on which one they like the best and once a design is approved she preps it for screening. She uses her Cricut to print a screen of her design and then, using a traditional screen printer, she sets the fabric, whether it be a canvas tote or a cotton shirt, under the screen making sure it is as smooth as possible and there are no wrinkles. She then adds painters tape to keep the screen in place and lays a thick line of Speedball fabric paint on the screen above her design. She then places a squeegee at the top of the screen and firmly pulls the squeegee fully across the screen to spread the paint. She then takes the screen off and sets the shirt aside to dry making sure to lay in flat as to not ruin the design.</p>
